# disrespecht.vbs

## Motivation:
Disrespect is a quick and dirty script to set network adapters to use DHCP. Derpy Community College was stuck in the dinosaur age and used static IP addresses.

In 2014 it was decided that DHCP addressing was to be used. A method to quickly make a change to approximately 1800 computers was needed. Thus disrespecht.vbs was born. It is sarcastically named in honor of the supervisor who previously required static addressing to be used.

* This script is designed to be quick and dirty and get the job done, not pretty.
